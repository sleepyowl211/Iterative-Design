                        is a online education platform that allows employors to assign employees
                        3-week livestream courses
                        instructed by experts in the field. Through Sphere, employees can learn functional skills to
                        apply
                        to their work, submit online assignments, and network with fellow students and instructors.</li>

            <h4>Post-test questions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>What frustrated you most about this app?
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>I would say the lack of labels for the icons, which made navigation more exploratory rather
                            than
                            self-explanatory.</li>
                        <li>Lack of words under the four icons at the bottom of the screen.</li>
                        <li>Nothing, everything was easy to find and use.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>Were there any interactive elements that were not immediately intuitive to you?
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>No. I believe the icons at the bottom were the only confusing part to me.</li>
                        <li>All available functions worked well.</li>
                        <li>No, everything was either self-explanatory/intuitive. Anyone who is used to using a
                            computer/smartphone should quickly learn how to use this app.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>What did you like about the app?
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>I like how you can navigate between icons using the links provided on each icon page
                            (connectivity amongst the pages making navigation easier).</li>
                        <li>The static menu on the bottom. Keeps the user from being lost.</li>
                        <li>Very simple/clean/easy to use interface and design. I wish Canvas was like this.</li>

            <h3>Analysis of result</h3>
            <h4>User behavior</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>All users completed task successfully</li>
                <li>Users found different ways to navigate to the chat page, with some using the nav bar directly and
                    others
                    accessing it from the course page </li>
                <li>One user was confused about task completion, unsure if they were supposed to be able to
                    actually send a message</li>
                <li>One user was confused about the company name listed under the courses in "my courses" page. They
                    seem to
                    expect instructor name rather than company name.

            <h4>Feedback</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>All users have concerns about lack of labels on navigation bar and confusion about the book icon
                </li>
                <li>One user mentioned lack of labels on chat page for distinguishing instructors from students. They
                    interpreted
                    the star icons as "favorite", instead of instructor.
                </li>
                <li>All thought the rest of the UI is simple and intuitive</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Potential changes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Add labels for underneath icons in the navigation bar</li>
                <li>Label instructors on the chat page through words instead of icons</li>
                <li>Unify time notation to regular time instead of military time</li>
                <li>Add link from livestream page to course page</li>
                <li>Display instructor names on my courses page, instead of the user's company name</li>
